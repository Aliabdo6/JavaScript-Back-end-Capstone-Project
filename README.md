## Project Overview

This project is a capstone designed to integrate and showcase various aspects of back-end development with JavaScript. It involves creating RESTful APIs, managing databases, implementing authentication and authorization, and ensuring best practices for coding and project structure.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Implementation of a RESTful API following best practices.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure user authentication and role-based access control.
- **Database Management**: Efficient handling of database operations using an ORM.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms.
- **Scalability**: Scalable architecture to handle growing data and user base.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation of API endpoints and project structure.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB to manage data relationships.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
- **Jest**: Testing framework for writing and running tests.
- **Swagger**: API documentation tool.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aliabdo6/JavaScript-Back-end-Capstone-Project.git
   cd JavaScript-Back-end-Capstone-Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. Refer to the `.env.example` file for guidance.

4. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

To use the application, you can send HTTP requests to the available endpoints. Below are some example commands using `curl`:

```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"testuser", "password":"testpassword"}' http://localhost:3000/api/register

# Login
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"testuser", "password":"testpassword"}' http://localhost:3000/api/login
```

For a complete list of available endpoints and their descriptions, refer to the [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints) section.

## API Endpoints

Here is a summary of the main API endpoints:

- **Auth**
  - `POST /api/register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /api/login`: Authenticate a user and return a JWT.

- **User**
  - `GET /api/users`: Get a list of all users (admin only).
  - `GET /api/users/:id`: Get details of a specific user.

- **Item**
  - `GET /api/items`: Get a list of all items.
  - `POST /api/items`: Create a new item.
  - `GET /api/items/:id`: Get details of a specific item.
  - `PUT /api/items/:id`: Update a specific item.
  - `DELETE /api/items/:id`: Delete a specific item.

Refer to the [Swagger documentation](http://localhost:3000/api-docs) for detailed information about each endpoint, including request and response formats.
